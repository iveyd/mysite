I am really glad we were given this assignment because
I have been wanting to do a website redesign, but just
needed the excuse. I tried to have fun with this, and 
I am happy with how it turned out. It was definitely 
worth the time I put in. I had the most trouble with 
the css flipper, but I think that it looks very nice, 
so worth.

Resources:
Plotka, Hay, Stackoverflow, bootstrap for the template 
which was the heavy basis of the design.
