I have some experience with SQL, so this lab was not too bad. I did have to look a few things up because I couldn't quite remember the syntax and creating the rows for the tables was fairly tedious, but all in all, it was fun to do SQL again.

FYI, at this point my website is still under construction so it may be a bit before this labs goes up there.
