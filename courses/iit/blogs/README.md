This was a huge pain to figure out what to do. I started so lost.
I eventually got a better understanding of what I was doing from 
looking at other feeds. From there everything was pretty straight
forward. The only other issue I found was not all feeds were
formatted the same way, so finding consistant information was 
difficult.
