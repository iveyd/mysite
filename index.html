  <p>From a young age, I have really had a love for technology. From computer and web science and IT to computer building and computer games, technology has been a large part of my life. I also enjoy listening to and playing music, watching movies, and spending time with friends and family.</p>

        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>I have been playing Stringed instruments since I was fifteen and I have loved every second. I have always used music to recharge myself if I feel anxious or a little drained. My go-to instrument is my guitar, but I also enjoy playing the bass guitar, mandolin, and ukulele.</p>

        <h4>Writing</h4>
        <p>I love where writing can take you. You just have to put the pen to paper (or fingers on the keyboard more likely). You can create a whole new world filled with magic and fantasy or describe a scene from a day you spent on the beach. You are only limited by your imagination.</p>

        <h4>Games</h4>
        <p>One of my favorite ways to relax and have fun is to play games. I find that playing computer games helps me to destress and relax after a long day and have a lot of fun playing them. I also really enjoy playing board games. They are a great way to spend time with people and be social.</p>
